## Build

### SDL

Setup SDL by downloading the `SDL2-devel-{version}-mingw` package from [github/SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases)
Then extract the folder `x86_64-w64-mingw32` into `C:/Libs/` so that the final include directory for the SDL is `C:/Libs/x86_64-w64-mingw32/include`
