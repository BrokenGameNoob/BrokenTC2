# New Features
- Joysticks are now recognized as valid inputs for the software (They are considered as buttons)
- You now have the possibility to chose one button from the controller to directly engage a specific gear. Note that if you are in mode "Standard sequential", the software will briefly switch to the "clutch" mode to enforce the gear to be engaged (it is unnoticeable).
